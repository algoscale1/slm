7,Form 51-102F6 Statement of Executive Compensation,"2.1 Compensation discussion and analysis(1) Describe and explain all significant elements of compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to NEOs for the most recently completed financial year. Include the following:(a) the objectives of any compensation program or strategy;(b) what the compensation program is designed to reward;(c) each element of compensation;(d) why the company chooses to pay each element;(e) how the company determines the amount (and, where applicable, the formula) for each element; and(f) how each element of compensation and the company's decisions about that element fit into the company's overall compensation objectives and affect decisions about other elements.(2) If applicable, describe any new actions, decisions or policies that were made after the end of the most recently completed financial year that could affect a reasonable person's understanding of an NEO's compensation for the most recently completed financial year.(3) If applicable, clearly state the benchmark and explain its components, including the companies included in the benchmark group and the selection criteria. (4) If applicable, disclose performance goals or similar conditions that are based on objective, identifiable measures, such as the company's share price or earnings per share. If performance goals or similar conditions are subjective, the company may describe the performance goal or similar condition without providing specific measures. If the company discloses performance goals or similar conditions that are non-GAAP financial measures, explain how the company calculates these performance goals or similar conditions from its financial statements.Exemption The company is not required to disclose performance goals or similar conditions in respect of specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related factors if a reasonable person would consider that disclosing them would seriously prejudice the company's interests.For the purposes of this exemption, a company's interests are not considered to be seriously prejudiced solely by disclosing performance goals or similar conditions if those goals or conditions are based on broad corporate-level financial performance metrics which include earnings per share, revenue growth, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This exemption does not apply if it has publicly disclosed the performance goals or similar conditions.If the company is relying on this exemption, state this fact and explain why disclosing the performance goals or similar conditions would seriously prejudice the company's interests.If the company does not disclose specific performance goals or similar conditions, state what percentage of the NEO's total compensation relates to this undisclosed information and how difficult it could be for the NEO, or how likely it will be for the company, to achieve the undisclosed performance goal or similar condition.(5) Disclose whether or not the board of directors, or a committee of the board, considered the implications of the risks associated with the company's compensation policies and practices.  If the implications were considered, disclose the following: (a) the extent and nature of the board of directors or committee's role in the risk oversight of the company's compensation policies and practices; (b) any practices the company uses to identify and mitigate compensation policies and practices that could encourage an NEO or individual at a principal business unit or division to take inappropriate or excessive risks;(c) any identified risks arising from the company's compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.(6) Disclose whether or not an NEO or director is permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds, that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.Commentary1. The information disclosed under section 2.1 will depend on the facts. Provide enough analysis to allow a reasonable person to understand the disclosure elsewhere in this form. Describe the significant principles underlying policies and explain the decisions relating to compensation provided to an NEO. Disclosure that merely describes the process for determining compensation or compensation already awarded, earned, paid, or payable is not adequate. The information contained in this section should give readers a sense of how compensation is tied to the NEO's performance. Avoid boilerplate language.2.  If the company's process for determining executive compensation is very simple, for example, the company relies solely on board discussion without any formal objectives, criteria and analysis, then make this clear in the discussion.3. If the company used any benchmarking in determining compensation or any element of compensation, include the benchmark group and describe why the benchmark group and selection criteria are considered by the company to be relevant.4. The following are examples of items that will usually be significant elements of disclosure concerning compensation:(a)contractual or non-contractual arrangements, plans, process changes or any other matters that might cause the amounts disclosed for the most recently completed financial year to be misleading if used as an indicator of expected compensation levels in future periods;(b)the process for determining perquisites and personal benefits;(c)policies and decisions about the adjustment or recovery of awards, earnings, payments, or payables if the performance goal or similar condition on which they are based is restated or adjusted to reduce the award, earning, payment, or payable;(d)the basis for selecting events that trigger payment for any arrangement that provides for payment at, following or in connection with any termination or change of control;(e)any waiver or change to any specified performance goal or similar condition to payout for any amount, including whether the waiver or change applied to one or more specified NEOs or to all compensation subject to the performance goal or similar condition;(f)whether the board of directors can exercise a discretion, either to award compensation absent attainment of the relevant performance goal or similar condition or to reduce or increase the size of any award or payout, including if they exercised discretion and whether it applied to one or more named executive officers;(g)whether the company will be making any significant changes to its compensation policies and practices in the next financial year;(h)the role of executive officers in determining executive compensation; and(i)performance goals or similar conditions in respect of specific quantitative or qualitative performance-related factors for NEOs.5. The following are examples of situations that could potentially encourage an executive officer to expose the company to inappropriate or excessive risks:(a) compensation policies and practices at a principal business unit of the company or a subsidiary of the company that are structured significantly differently than others within the company;(b)compensation policies and practices for certain executive officers that are structured significantly differently than other executive officers within the company;  (c) compensation policies and practices that do not include effective risk management and regulatory compliance as part of the performance metrics used in determining compensation;(d) compensation policies and practices where the compensation expense to executive officers is a significant percentage of the company's revenue;(e) compensation policies and practices that vary significantly from the overall compensation structure of the company; (f) compensation policies and practices where incentive plan awards are awarded upon accomplishment of a task while the risk to the company from that task extends over a significantly longer period of time;(g) compensation policies and practices that contain performance goals or similar conditions that are heavily weighed to short-term rather than long-term objectives; (h) incentive plan awards that do not provide a maximum benefit or payout limit to executive officers. The examples above are not exhaustive and the situations to consider will vary depending upon the nature of the company's business and the company's compensation policies and practices.",0.058306895196437836
8,Form 51-102F6 Statement of Executive Compensation,"3.1 Summary compensation table  Commentary Under subsection (1), a company is not required to disclose comparative period disclosure in accordance with the requirements of either Form 51-102F6 Statement of Executive Compensation, which came into force on March 30, 2004, as amended, or this form, in respect of a financial year ending before December 31, 2008. (2) In column (c), include the dollar value of cash and non-cash base salary an NEO earned during a financial year covered in the table (a covered financial year). If the company cannot calculate the amount of salary earned in a financial year, disclose this in a footnote, along with the reason why it cannot be determined. Restate the salary figure the next time the company prepares this form, and explain what portion of the restated figure represents an amount that the company could not previously calculate.  (3) In column (d), disclose the dollar amount based on the fair value of the award on the grant date for a covered financial year.  (4) In column (e), disclose the dollar amount based on the fair value of the award on the grant date for a covered financial year. Include option-based awards both with or without tandem share appreciation rights.  (5) For an award disclosed in column (d) or (e), in a narrative after the table, (a) describe the methodology used to calculate the fair value of the award on the grant date, disclose the key assumptions and estimates used for each calculation, and explain why the company chose that methodology, and(b) if the fair value of the award on the grant date is different from the fair value determined in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (accounting fair value), state the amount of the difference and explain the reasons for the difference. Commentary1. This commentary applies to subsections (3), (4) and (5). 2.  The value disclosed in columns (d) and (e) of the summary compensation table should reflect what the company paid, made payable, awarded, granted, gave or otherwise provided as compensation on the grant date (fair value of the award) as set out in comment 3, below. This value might differ from the value reported in the issuer's financial statements.  3.  While compensation practices vary, there are generally two approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation. A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company to be awarded or paid as compensation. Alternatively, a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the company to be transferred as compensation. A fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these approaches. A company may calculate this value either in accordance with a valuation methodology identified in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment or in accordance with another methodology set out in comment 5 below. 4. In some cases, the fair value of the award disclosed in columns (d) and (e) might differ from the accounting fair value. For financial statement purposes, the accounting fair value amount is amortized over the service period to obtain an accounting cost (accounting compensation expense), adjusted at year end as required.5. While the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the value of most types of awards are the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use another valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and reasonable estimate of fair value. 6. The summary compensation table requires disclosure of an amount even if the accounting compensation expense is zero. The amount disclosed in the table should reflect the fair value of the award following the principles described under comments 2 and 3, above. 7. Column (d) includes common shares, restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred share units, phantom shares, phantom share units, common share equivalent units, stock, and similar instruments that do not have option-like features.  (6) In column (e), include the incremental fair value if, at any time during the covered financial year, the company has adjusted, amended, cancelled, replaced or significantly modified the exercise price of options previously awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to, an NEO. The repricing or modification date must be determined in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The methodology used to calculate the incremental fair value must be the same methodology used to calculate the initial grant. This requirement does not apply to any repricing that equally affects all holders of the class of securities underlying the options and that occurs through a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in the periodic adjustment of the option exercise or base price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or similar transaction. (7) nclude a footnote to the table quantifying the incremental fair value of any adjusted, amended, cancelled, replaced or significantly modified options that are included in the table. (8) In column (f), include the dollar value of all amounts earned for services performed during the covered financial year that are related to awards under non-equity incentive plans and all earnings on any such outstanding awards.(a) If the relevant performance goal or similar condition was satisfied during a covered financial year (including for a single year in a plan with a multi-year performance goal or similar condition), report the amounts earned for that financial year, even if they are payable at a later date. The company is not required to report these amounts again in the summary compensation table when they are actually paid to an NEO. (b) Include a footnote describing and quantifying all amounts earned on non-equity incentive plan compensation, whether they were paid during the financial year, were payable but deferred at the election of an NEO, or are payable by their terms at a later date. (c) Include any discretionary cash awards, earnings, payments, or payables that were not based on pre-determined performance goals or similar conditions that were communicated to an NEO. Report any performance-based plan awards that include pre-determined performance goals or similar conditions in column (f). (d) In column (f1), include annual non-equity incentive plan compensation, such as bonuses and discretionary amounts. For column (f1), annual non-equity incentive plan compensation relates only to a single financial year. In column (f2), include all non-equity incentive plan compensation related to a period longer than one year. (9) In column (g), include all compensation relating to defined benefit or defined contribution plans. These include service costs and other compensatory items such as plan changes and earnings that are different from the estimated earnings for defined benefit plans and above-market earnings for defined contribution plans.  This disclosure relates to all plans that provide for the payment of pension plan benefits. Use the same amounts included in column (e) of the defined benefit plan table required by Item 5 for the covered financial year and the amounts included in column (c) of the defined contribution plan table as required by Item 5 for the covered financial year. (10) In column (h), include all other compensation not reported in any other column of this table. Column (h) must include, but is not limited to: (a) perquisites, including property or other personal benefits provided to an NEO that are not generally available to all employees, and that in aggregate are worth $50,000 or more, or are worth 10% or more of an NEO's total salary for the financial year. Value these items on the basis of the aggregate incremental cost to the company and its subsidiaries. Describe in a footnote the methodology used for computing the aggregate incremental cost to the company. State the type and amount of each perquisite the value of which exceeds 25% of the total value of perquisites reported for an NEO in a footnote to the table. Provide the footnote information for the most recently completed financial year only;(b) other post-retirement benefits such as health insurance or life insurance after retirement; (c) all 'gross-ups' or other amounts reimbursed during the covered financial year for the payment of taxes; (d) the incremental payments, payables, and benefits to an NEO that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario listed in section 6.1 that occurred before the end of the covered financial year; (e) the dollar value of any insurance premiums paid or payable by, or on behalf of, the company during the covered financial year for personal insurance for an NEO if the estate of the NEO is the beneficiary;(f) the dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid or payable on share-based or option-based awards that were not factored into the fair value of the award on the grant date required to be reported in columns (d) and (e); (g) any compensation cost for any security that the NEO bought from the company or its subsidiaries at a discount from the market price of the security (through deferral of salary, bonus or otherwise). Calculate this cost at the date of purchase and in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and (h) above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred on a basis that is not tax exempt other than for defined contribution plans covered in the defined contribution plan table in Item 5. Above-market or preferential applies to non-registered plans and means a rate greater than the rate ordinarily paid by the company or its subsidiary on securities or other obligations having the same or similar features issued to third parties. (i) any company contribution to a personal savings plan like a registered retirement savings plan made on behalf of the NEO. Commentary 1. Generally, there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario described in section 6.1 that occurred before the end of a covered financial year for compensation that has been reported in the summary compensation table for the most recently completed financial year or for a financial year before the most recently completed financial year.  If the vesting or payout of the previously reported compensation is accelerated, or a performance goal or similar condition in respect of the previously reported compensation is waived, as a result of a scenario described in section 6.1, the incremental payments, payables, and benefits should include the value of the accelerated benefit or of the waiver of the performance goal or similar condition. 2. Generally, an item is not a perquisite if it is integrally and directly related to the performance of an executive officer's duties. If something is necessary for a person to do his or her job, it is integrally and directly related to the job and is not a perquisite, even if it also provides some amount of personal benefit. If the company concludes that an item is not integrally and directly related to performing the job, it may be a perquisite if the item provides an NEO with any direct or indirect personal benefit. If it does provide a personal benefit, the item is a perquisite, whether or not it is provided for a business reason or for the company's convenience, unless it is generally available on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees. Companies must conduct their own analysis of whether a particular item is a perquisite. The following are examples of things that are often considered perquisites or personal benefits. This list is not exhaustive:(a)Cars, car lease and car allowance;(b)Corporate aircraft or personal travel financed by the company;(c)Jewellery;(d)Clothing;(e)Artwork;(f)Housekeeping services;(g)Club membership;(h)Theatre tickets;(i)Financial assistance to provide education to children of executive officers;(j)Parking;(k)Personal financial or tax advice;(l)Security at personal residence or during personal travel; and(m)Reimbursements of taxes owed with respect to perquisites or other personal benefit.(11) n column (i), include the dollar value of total compensation for the covered financial year. For each NEO, this is the sum of the amounts reported in columns (c) through (h).(12)  Any deferred amounts must be included in the appropriate column for the covered financial year in which they are earned.(13) If an NEO elected to exchange any compensation awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to the NEO in a covered financial year under a program that allows the NEO to receive awards, earnings, payments, or payables in another form, the compensation the NEO elected to exchange must be reported as compensation in the column appropriate for the form of compensation exchanged: Do not report it in the form in which it was or will be received by the NEO.

This includes but is not limited to, non-compete, non-solicitation, non-disparagement or confidentiality agreements. Include the term of these agreements and provisions for waiver or breach; and(e) any other significant factors for each written contract, agreement, plan or arrangement.(2) Disclose the estimated incremental payments, payables, and benefits even if it is uncertain what amounts might be paid in given circumstances under the various plans and arrangements, assuming that the triggering event took place on the last business day of the company's most recently completed financial year. For valuing share-based awards or option-based awards, use the closing market price of the company's securities on that date. If the company is unsure about the provision or amount of payments or benefits, make a reasonable estimate (or a reasonable estimate of the range of amounts) and disclose the significant assumptions underlying these estimates.(3) Despite subsection (1), the company is not required to disclose the following:(a) Perquisites and other personal benefits if the aggregate of this compensation is less than $50,000. State the individual perquisites and personal benefits as required by paragraph 3.1(10)(a).(b) Information about possible termination scenarios for an NEO whose employment terminated in the past year. The company must only disclose the consequences of the actual termination. (c) Information in respect of a scenario described in subsection (1) if there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, that scenario. Commentary1. Subsection (1) does not require the company to disclose notice of termination without cause, or compensation in lieu thereof, which are implied as a term of an employment contract under common law or civil law.2. Item 6 applies to changes of control regardless of whether the change of control results in termination of employment.3.
