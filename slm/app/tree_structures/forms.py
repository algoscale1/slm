"1. The information disclosed under section 2.1 will depend on the facts. Provide enough analysis to allow a reasonable person to understand the disclosure elsewhere in this form. Describe the significant principles underlying policies and explain the decisions relating to compensation provided to an NEO. Disclosure that merely describes the process for determining compensation or compensation already awarded, earned, paid, or payable is not adequate. The information contained in this section should give readers a sense of how compensation is tied to the NEO's performance. Avoid boilerplate language."\
"2.  If the company's process for determining executive compensation is very simple, for example, the company relies solely on board discussion without any formal objectives, criteria and analysis, then make this clear in the discussion."\

"(b)the process for determining perquisites and personal benefits;"\
"(c)policies and decisions about the adjustment or recovery of awards, earnings, payments, or payables if the performance goal or similar condition on which they are based is restated or adjusted to reduce the award, earning, payment, or payable;"\
"(d)the basis for selecting events that trigger payment for any arrangement that provides for payment at, following or in connection with any termination or change of control;"\
"(e)any waiver or change to any specified performance goal or similar condition to payout for any amount, including whether the waiver or change applied to one or more specified NEOs or to all compensation subject to the performance goal or similar condition;"\
"(f)whether the board of directors can exercise a discretion, either to award compensation absent attainment of the relevant performance goal or similar condition or to reduce or increase the size of any award or payout, including if they exercised discretion and whether it applied to one or more named executive officers;"\
"(g)whether the company will be making any significant changes to its compensation policies and practices in the next financial year;"\
"(h)the role of executive officers in determining executive compensation; and"\

"(a) compensation policies and practices at a principal business unit of the company or a subsidiary of the company that are structured significantly differently than others within the company;"\
"(b)compensation policies and practices for certain executive officers that are structured significantly differently than other executive officers within the company;  "\
"(c) compensation policies and practices that do not include effective risk management and regulatory compliance as part of the performance metrics used in determining compensation;"\
"(d) compensation policies and practices where the compensation expense to executive officers is a significant percentage of the company's revenue;"\
"(e) compensation policies and practices that vary significantly from the overall compensation structure of the company; "\
"(f) compensation policies and practices where incentive plan awards are awarded upon accomplishment of a task while the risk to the company from that task extends over a significantly longer period of time;"\
"(g) compensation policies and practices that contain performance goals or similar conditions that are heavily weighed to short-term rather than long-term objectives; "\

"Commentary"\
"1. This commentary applies to subsections (3), (4) and (5). "\
"2.  The value disclosed in columns (d) and (e) of the summary compensation table should reflect what the company paid, made payable, awarded, granted, gave or otherwise provided as compensation on the grant date (fair value of the award) as set out in comment 3, below. This value might differ from the value reported in the issuer's financial statements.  "\
"3.  While compensation practices vary, there are generally two approaches that boards of directors use when setting compensation. A board of directors may decide the value in securities of the company to be awarded or paid as compensation. Alternatively, a board of directors may decide the portion of the potential ownership of the company to be transferred as compensation. A fair value ascribed to the award will normally result from these approaches. A company may calculate this value either in accordance with a valuation methodology identified in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment or in accordance with another methodology set out in comment 5 below. "\
"4. In some cases, the fair value of the award disclosed in columns (d) and (e) might differ from the accounting fair value. For financial statement purposes, the accounting fair value amount is amortized over the service period to obtain an accounting cost (accounting compensation expense), adjusted at year end as required."\
"5. While the most commonly used methodologies for calculating the value of most types of awards are the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the binomial lattice model, companies may choose to use another valuation methodology if it produces a more meaningful and reasonable estimate of fair value. "\
"6. The summary compensation table requires disclosure of an amount even if the accounting compensation expense is zero. The amount disclosed in the table should reflect the fair value of the award following the principles described under comments 2 and 3, above. "\
"7. Column (d) includes common shares, restricted shares, restricted share units, deferred share units, phantom shares, phantom share units, common share equivalent units, stock, and similar instruments that do not have option-like features.  "\
"(6) In column (e), include the incremental fair value if, at any time during the covered financial year, the company has adjusted, amended, cancelled, replaced or significantly modified the exercise price of options previously awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to, an NEO. The repricing or modification date must be determined in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The methodology used to calculate the incremental fair value must be the same methodology used to calculate the initial grant. This requirement does not apply to any repricing that equally affects all holders of the class of securities underlying the options and that occurs through a pre-existing formula or mechanism in the plan or award that results in the periodic adjustment of the option exercise or base price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a recapitalization or similar transaction.

"(h) above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred on a basis that is not tax exempt other than for defined contribution plans covered in the defined contribution plan table in Item 5.

"(i) any company contribution to a personal savings plan like a registered retirement savings plan made on behalf of the NEO. "\
"Commentary "\
"1. Generally, there will be no incremental payments, payables, and benefits that are triggered by, or result from, a scenario described in section 6.1 that occurred before the end of a covered financial year for compensation that has been reported in the summary compensation table for the most recently completed financial year or for a financial year before the most recently completed financial year.  If the vesting or payout of the previously reported compensation is accelerated, or a performance goal or similar condition in respect of the previously reported compensation is waived, as a result of a scenario described in section 6.1, the incremental payments, payables, and benefits should include the value of the accelerated benefit or of the waiver of the performance goal or similar condition. "\
"2. Generally, an item is not a perquisite if it is integrally and directly related to the performance of an executive officer's duties. If something is necessary for a person to do his or her job, it is integrally and directly related to the job and is not a perquisite, even if it also provides some amount of personal benefit. If the company concludes that an item is not integrally and directly related to performing the job, it may be a perquisite if the item provides an NEO with any direct or indirect personal benefit. If it does provide a personal benefit, the item is a perquisite, whether or not it is provided for a business reason or for the company's convenience, unless it is generally available on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees. Companies must conduct their own analysis of whether a particular item is a perquisite. The following are examples of things that are often considered perquisites or personal benefits.

If the vesting or payout of the previously reported compensation is accelerated, or a performance goal or similar condition in respect of the previously reported compensation is waived, as a result of a scenario described in subsection (1), the incremental payments, payables, and benefits should include the value of the accelerated benefit or of the waiver of the performance goal or similar condition.
