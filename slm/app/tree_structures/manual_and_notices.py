Each director of a listed issuer must be elected by a majority (50% +1 vote) of the votes cast with respect to his or her election other than at contested meetings ('Majority Voting Requirement'). A listed issuer must adopt a majority voting policy (a 'Policy'), unless it otherwise satisfies the Majority Voting Requirement in a manner acceptable to TSX, for example, by applicable statutes, articles, by-laws or other similar instruments.
